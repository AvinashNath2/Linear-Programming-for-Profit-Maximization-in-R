# Linear-Programming-for-Profit-Maximization-in-R
Linear programming is an optimization technique for a system of linear constraints and a linear objective function. An objective function defines the quantity to be optimized, and the goal of linear programming is to find the values of the variables that maximize or minimize the objective function.

## Introduction

Linear programming is a simple technique where we depict complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. The important word in previous sentence is depict. The real relationships might be much more complex – but we can simplify them to linear relationships.

The word linear means the relationship which canbe represented by a straight line .i.e the relation is of theformax +by=c. In other words it is used to describe therelationship between two or more variables which areproportional to each other The word “programming” is concerned with theoptimal allocation of limited
